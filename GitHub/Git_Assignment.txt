1: Create a directory 'project_dir' and cd to 'project_dir'.

-> AJPRADHA@LIN24009065 MINGW64 /
   $ mkdir project_dir

   AJPRADHA@LIN24009065 MINGW64 /
   $ cd project_dir

   AJPRADHA@LIN24009065 MINGW64 /project_dir



2: Initialize git version database

-> AJPRADHA@LIN24009065 MINGW64 /project_dir
$ git init
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint:   git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint:   git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/AJPRADHA/Downloads/PortableGit/project_dir/.git/

AJPRADHA@LIN24009065 MINGW64 /project_dir (master)



3: create new file index.html

-> AJPRADHA@LIN24009065 MINGW64 /project_dir (master)
$ ls
index.txt

AJPRADHA@LIN24009065 MINGW64 /project_dir (master)
$ git add index.txt

AJPRADHA@LIN24009065 MINGW64 /project_dir (master)
$



4: check the git status. You should find index.html as untracked file.
-> AJPRADHA@LIN24009065 MINGW64 /project_dir (master)
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        index.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)




5: stage the index.html file
-> AJPRADHA@LIN24009065 MINGW64 /project_dir (master)
$ git add index.txt
 



6: commit index.html
-> AJPRADHA@LIN24009065 MINGW64 /project_dir (master)
$ git commit -m "that's work haa"
